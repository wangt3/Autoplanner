Autoplanner: An autoplanner to plan out tasks that require a long time to perform, like lab assignments
or studying that may take multiple hours/days/weeks. If you can estimate a timeframe for how long
you think the project will take, this autoplanner will help automatically chop up and assign times for
you to work on your large assigments. (Its nice to estimate a time, then multiply it by 1.5 for any
project in general, as we are horribly bad at estimating things)
